      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mick Ward. I am a senior Computer Science major at the University of Dayton, and I am graduating in May 2022. I am interested in being hired for a full time development or security based job to apply all that I have learned in and outside the classroom!",
      "description2": "At UD, I am the current President of the Association for Computing Machinery. This position involves me organizing our chapterâ€™s weekly meetings, as well as coming up with and deciding on content that will be covered at the meetings. This content involves everything from development to cyber security. I served as the Womenâ€™s Volleyball Chair of the Red Scare executive board, which is the student section for the sports at UD. We plan giveaways, incentives, marketing, and events in order to create an electric environment in the stands. I am also a member of the Management Information Systems Club. As well as all this, I compete on Daytonâ€™s Cyber Security Team in the National Cyber League tournament, where we compete in 2 annual tournaments in CyberSecurity based tasks.",

This is one of the greatest experiences I have had! I was developing on a team of around 40 developers, and I was writing code that was being used in the real world! I was able to learn many new tools, and gained a lot of expereince with React and TypeScript. I had my code reviewed by extremely talented senior developers, and they taught me coding practices I will use for the rest of my career",

This class had the frontend take a backseat, in order for us to focus on making the website completely secure. In the class, we built a deep understanding about the ways in which websites are attacked, and used this to develop applications from a security mindset. Feel free to follow the link to the repository to read about all the security principles that are applied to our social media site to make it secure!",
